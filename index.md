## Welcome to my fundraising page

I am raising money for my school [Birkenshaw C.E. (C) Primary School](https://www.birkenshawprimary.org.uk/) to support the funding of the annual leasing of the minibus. The minibus has been a fabulous addition to school and benefited children across all year groups. 

The minibus costs school £5000.00 each school year and I, amongst other children in school are raising a small amount money each with the hope that it collectively contributes towards a larger amount to keep the minibus going for our next school year.

Our school have set the **2022 Challenge** which within the last month before the end of the school year they are encouraging the children to raise **at least £20.22**!

### How am I going to raise the money?
After I have received your sponsorship and donation I will attempt to draw a picture of your choosing & post it on my website for the world to see. My favourite things to draw at the moment are characters from Sonic The Hedgehog, Super Mario, Minecraft and Among Us. But I am up for a challenge, so please don't let these things limit your choices of things for me to draw.

### How can you sponsor me?
1. Complete the sponsorship form with your Name, Address (for GiftAid) and your picture request.
2. Send your donation to my Dads [PayPal.me page](https://paypal.me/andyboot).
3. I will draw & upload your requested picture and post here along with your name.
